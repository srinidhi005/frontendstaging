(a) Total equity balance decreased by $(14,408) million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to reduction of noncontrolling interest 
balance of $(19,239) million attributable to Baker Hughes Class A shareholders at December 31, 2018, after-tax loss of $(8,238) 
million in discontinued operations due to deconsolidation of Baker Hughes in 2019, and after-tax net realized and unrealized loss on 
our remaining interest in Baker Hughes of $(936) million in 2019 and 2020, partially offset by after-tax gain of $11,213 million due to 
the sale of our BioPharma business within our Healthcare segment, and after-tax gain of $2,508 million in discontinued operations 
due to spin-off and subsequent merger of our Transportation business with Wabtec in 2019.
