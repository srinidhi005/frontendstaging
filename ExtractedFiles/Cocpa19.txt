Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
The Board of Directors

Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Colorado Society of Certified Public 
Accountants which comprise the statements of financial position as of April 30, 2019 and 2018, and the 
related statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended, the statement of functional 
expenses for the year ended April 30, 2019, and the related notes to the financial statements. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.

Note 1 -  Nature of the Organization 
 
The Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants (the “COCPA”) is a nonprofit organization whose mission is 
to support its members in providing quality professional services to serve the public interest. The COCPA’s 
revenues are derived primarily from dues that it charges its members, who are located primarily in the State of 
Colorado, and continuing professional education fees.

Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 
As of May 1, 2018, the COCPA adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-14, 
Presentation of Financial Statements for Not-For-Profit Entities. The provisions of the ASU replace the existing 
three classes of net assets with two new classes (net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor 
restrictions) and enhance the disclosure requirements for the donor restricted endowment funds and 
underwater endowments. The ASU introduces new disclosure requirements to provide information about what 
is included or excluded from the intermediate measure of operations as well as disclosures to improve a 
financial statement user’s ability to assess the entity’s liquidity and exposure to risk. The ASU also introduces 
new reporting requirements to present expenses by both function and natural classification in a single location 
and to present investment returns on the statements of activities net of external and direct internal investment 
expenses. 
 
The amendments should be applied on a retrospective basis; however, if presenting comparative financial 
statements, the ASU allows for the option to omit, for any periods presented before the period of adoption, the 
analysis of expenses by both natural classification and functional classification, and the disclosure about liquidity 
and availability of resources. The separate presentation of expenses by functional classification and expenses by 
natural classification is still required. The COCPA has elected not to present comparative information for these 
amendments. The COCPA has adopted this standard as management believes the standard improves the 
usefulness and understandability of the COCPA’s financial reporting 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The COCPA considers all cash and highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or 
less, and which are neither held for nor restricted by donors for long-term purposes, to be cash and cash 
equivalents. 
 
Accounts Receivable 
 
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. 
Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and 
a review of subsequent collections. Balances that are outstanding after management has used reasonable 
collection efforts are written off. At April 30, 2019 and 2018, management believes the amount of uncollectible 
balances to be insignificant to the financial statements. 
 
Investments 
 
Investment purchases are initially recorded at cost. Thereafter, investments are reported at fair value in the 
statements of financial position. Net investment return/(loss) is reported in the statements of activities and 
consists of interest and dividend income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, less external and 
direct internal investment expenses.

Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2019 and 2018 
 
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment additions over $1,000 are recorded at cost, or if donated, at fair value on the date of 
donation. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets ranging from two to ten years, or in the case of capitalized leased assets or leasehold 
improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. When assets are sold or otherwise 
disposed of, the cost and related depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting 
gain or loss is included in the statements of activities. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor 
replacements that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are expensed currently. 
 
The COCPA reviews the carrying values of property and equipment for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future 
cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. When considered impaired, an impairment 
loss is recognized to the extent carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no indicators of 
asset impairment during the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018. 
 
Net Assets 
 
Net assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor- (or certain 
grantor-) imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified and reported as 
follows: 
 
Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions – Net assets available for use in general operations and not subject to 
donor- (or certain grantor-) imposed restrictions. The COCPA board may designate assets without donor 
restrictions for specific operational purposes from time to time. The board has designated, from net assets 
without donor restrictions, net assets for an operating reserve of $1,000,000 and $972,767 as of April 30, 
2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 
Net Assets With Donor Restrictions – Net assets subject to donor- (or certain grantor-) imposed restrictions. 
Some donor-imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met by the passage of 
time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor-imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, 
where the donor stipulates that resources be maintained in perpetuity. The COCPA had no net assets with 
donor restrictions as of April 30, 2019 and 2018. 
 
The COCPA reports contributions restricted by donors as increases in net assets without donor restrictions if the 
restrictions expire (that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished) in the 
reporting period in which the revenue is recognized. All other donor-restricted contributions are reported as 
increases in net assets with donor restrictions, depending on the nature of the restrictions. When a restriction 
expires, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported 
in the statements of activities as net assets released from restrictions.

Measure of Operations 
 
The statements of activities report all changes in net assets, including changes in net assets from operating and 
non-operating activities. Operating activities consist of those items attributable to the COCPA’s ongoing 
activities. Non-operating activities are limited to resources that generate return from investments, endowment 
contributions, financing costs, and other activities considered to be of a more unusual or nonrecurring nature. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Revenue is recognized when earned. Membership dues are recognized ratably over the term of the membership 
period. Continuing professional education fees are recognized in the period in which the course is given. Peer 
review administrative fees are billed and recognized as revenue during the administrative year to which they 
apply. Other revenue is recognized when earned. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, the COCPA recorded deferred 
revenue, which represents the portion of revenue collected during the fiscal year that applies to the subsequent 
year’s activity. 
 
Contributed Services 
 
Contributed services are recorded if they create or enhance nonfinancial assets or require specialized skills that 
are provided by an individual possessing those skills and would typically need to be purchased if not provided by 
donation. No significant contributed services were received during the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018. A 
significant portion of the COCPA’s functions, which are conducted by unpaid volunteers, is not reflected in the 
accompanying financial statements because it does not meet the criteria for recognition by generally accepted 
accounting principles. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
The COCPA uses advertising to promote its programs. Advertising costs, including professional advertising 
services provided by a major vendor, are expensed as incurred and totaled $213,570 and $200,795 for 
continuing professional education and $139,150 and $130,656 for member services, for the years ended April 
30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 
Functional Allocation of Expenses 
 
The costs of providing the various programs and other activities have been summarized on a functional basis in 
the statements of activities. The statement of functional expenses presents the natural classification detail of 
expenses by function. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs and supporting 
services benefitted. 
 
The financial statements report certain categories of expenses that are attributed to more than one program or 
supporting function. The expenses that are allocated include: labor and related expenses, events, travel, and 
meetings, office and insurance, which are allocated on the basis of time and effort; as well as occupancy, 
depreciation and amortization, which are allocated on a square-footage basis. Technology expenses related to 
the revenue-generating activities are allocated based on revenue, while other technology expenses are allocated 
based on time and effort.

April 30, 2019 and 2018 
 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The COCPA is exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
However, income from activities not directly related to the COCPA’s tax-exempt purpose is subject to taxation as 
unrelated business income. The COCPA’s unrelated business income primarily represents advertising revenue 
associated with the COCPA’s NewsAccount publication, website, and real property rental. The COCPA did not 
incur any material income tax expense from these unrelated activities for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 
2018. 
 
Management believes that the COCPA has appropriate support for any tax positions taken affecting its 
annual filing requirements, and as such, does not have any uncertain tax positions that are material to the 
financial statements. The COCPA would recognize future accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits and liabilities in income tax expense if such interest and penalties are incurred. The COCPA’s Form 
990, 990-T’s and other income tax filings required by state, local, or non-U.S. tax authorities are no longer 
subject to tax examination for years before 2016. 
 
Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences could be material. 
 
Financial Instruments and Credit Risk 
 
The COCPA manages deposit concentration risk by placing cash and money market accounts with financial 
institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. At times, amounts on deposit may exceed insured 
limits or include uninsured investments in money market mutual funds. To date, the COCPA has not experienced 
losses in any of these accounts. Credit risk associated with accounts receivable is considered to be limited due to 
high historical collection rates and because substantial portions of the outstanding amounts are due from 
members. Investments are managed by diversified investment managers who are selected by the Investment 
Committee of the Board of Directors and whose performance is monitored by COCPA management and the 
Investment Committee. Although the fair values of investments are subject to fluctuation on a year-to-year 
basis, management and the Investment Committee believe that the investment policies and guidelines are 
prudent for the long-term welfare of the COCPA. 
 
Concentration Risk 
 
Significant customers and vendors are those that account for greater than 10% of COCPA’s revenues and 
expenses. 
 
The COCPA has one major vendor that supports the website and association management system software as a 
service subscription and supplies marketing, communications, and IT consulting that accounted for 
approximately $506,676 and $490,777 or 14% and 13% of total expenses for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 
2018. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, $5,153 and $9,652, respectively, was payable to this vendor. 
11 
Page#14
Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2019 and 2018 
 
 
This vendor provides services to the COCPA which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise; 
however, the COCPA expects to maintain this relationship with the vendor. 
 
Subsequent Events 
 
The COCPA has evaluated subsequent events through July 24, 2019, the date at which the financial statements 
were available to be issued. 
 
 
Note 3 -  Liquidity and Availability 
 
The COCPA’s financial assets available within one year of the statement of financial position date for general 
expenditure are as follows: 
 
Cash and cash equivalents $ 277,861
Accounts receivable, net 67,321
Operating investments appropriated for distribution 117,450
$ 462,632
 
The COCPA’s financial assets have been reduced by amounts not available for general use because of the 
COCPA’s investment distribution policy, which limits investment return for operations to 5% of the average of 
the fair values of the investment assets at the end of the previous three calendar years. Amounts in excess of 
this 5% limit may be expended at the resolution of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors 
designated $1,000,000 for operating reserves as of April 30, 2019. Although the COCPA does not intend to spend 
from this board-designated fund (other than amounts appropriated for general expenditure as part of the 
Board’s annual budget approval and appropriation), these amounts could be made available if necessary. To 
help manage unanticipated liquidity needs, the COCPA has committed a line of credit in the amount of $225,000 
upon which it could draw (Note 7) 
 
 
Note 4 -  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
 
Certain assets are reported at fair value in the financial statements. Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset in an orderly transaction in the principal, or most advantageous, market at the measurement 
date under current market conditions regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. 
 
Inputs used to determine fair value refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable 
inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset based on 
market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that 
reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing 
the asset based on the best information available. 
12 
Page#15
Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2019 and 2018 
 
 
A three-tier hierarchy categorizes the inputs as follows: 
 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that the COCPA can access at the 
measurement date. 
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either 
directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for 
identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the asset, and market-corroborated inputs. 
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset. In these situations, inputs are developed using the best 
information available in the circumstances. 
In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset might be categorized within different levels 
of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same 
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. Assessing 
the significance of a particular input to the entire measurement requires judgment, taking into account factors 
specific to the asset. The categorization of an asset within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency 
of the asset and does not necessarily correspond to the COCPA’s assessment of the quality, risk, or liquidity 
profile of the asset. 
 
All of the COCPA’s investment assets are classified within Level 1 because they are composed of mutual funds 
with readily determinable fair values based on daily redemption values. The following table presents assets 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at April 30, 2019 and 2018:

Note 8 -  Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and Trust 
 
Effective May 1, 1985, the COCPA established, as a separate accounting entity, the Colorado Society of CPAs 
Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and Trust for the benefit of eligible COCPA employees. Both full-time and part-time 
employees of at least age 21 are eligible immediately upon commencing employment. Traditional and Roth 
401(k) options are available. Under the Roth 401(k) option, participants may make post-tax elective deferrals in 
addition to, or instead of, pre-tax elective deferrals under the traditional 401(k) option. A participant’s combined 
elective deferrals cannot exceed the IRS limits for traditional 401(k) deferrals. The COCPA has adopted Safe 
Harbor 401(k) provisions under which it matches participant contributions up to 5% of compensation. The 
COCPA’s contribution expense for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 was $52,995 and $54,879, 
respectively. Neither the assets nor the liabilities of the profit sharing/401(k) plan and trust are reflected in 
these financial statements.
