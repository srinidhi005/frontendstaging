Management’s Report on Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Company’s ability 
to record, process, summarize and report a system of internal accounting controls and procedures to provide 
reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposi-
tion of assets are prevented or timely detected and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly 
to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) and receipts and expenditures are duly authorized. In order to ensure the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the 
criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation, evaluation 
of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. Our system of internal control 
over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by our internal auditors, written policies and procedures 
and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of our 
Company. In addition, we have an internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional 
area within the Company, which performs a separate review of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are 
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did not include two 
acquisitions, Omnicare, Inc. and the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation, consummated during fiscal year 
2015. Omnicare, Inc. and the Target Corporation pharmacy and clinic businesses are included in the Company’s 
2015 consolidated financial statements and represent 18% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2% of net 
revenues for the year then ended.
Based on our assessment, we conclude our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and 
provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing 
financial statements as of December 31, 2015.
Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by the Board of Directors and ratified 
by our Company’s shareholders. They were engaged to render an opinion regarding the fair presentation of our 
consolidated financial statements as well as conducting an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Their 
accompanying reports are based upon audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
