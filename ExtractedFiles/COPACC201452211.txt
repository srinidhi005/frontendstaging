Independent Auditor’s Report

Englewood, Colorado 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Colorado Society of Certified Public 
Accountants which comprise the statements of financial position as of April 30, 2014 and 2013, and the 
related statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion. 
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants as of April 30, 2014 and 2013, 
and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Note 1 -  Nature of the Organization 
 
The Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants (the “COCPA”) is a nonprofit organization whose 
mission is to support its members in providing quality professional services to serve the public interest. 
The COCPA’s revenues are derived primarily from dues that it charges its membership, which is primarily 
located in the State of Colorado, and continuing professional education fees. 
Description of Activities 
 
 
The COCPA’s activities include the following: 
Membership Services 
 
 
Develops and provides services and benefits to members. Offers activities to assist members in 
understanding and adjusting to changes in the economic, political, social, and technological environment. 
Provides opportunities for members to participate in community, business, legislative, educational, and 
other activities where their expertise is needed. Includes networking, technical support, and legislative 
and regulatory representation and advocacy. Also includes programs and activities to recruit students 
 
into the profession and promote the profession to the public. 
Continuing Professional Education 
 
Provides educational instruction and materials on accounting, auditing, taxation, and other topics 
important to accounting professionals to assist in the continuing development of their professional 
expertise. 
Peer Review Services 
 
 
Provides services to members and nonmembers who are engaged in the practice of public accounting and 
are enrolled in an approved practice monitoring program, which monitors professional performance to 
enforce professional standards. 
General Administrative 
 
 
Provides overall direction, general record keeping, business management, general public relations, board 
of directors’ activities, and other. 
 
Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 
The COCPA considers all cash and highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three 
months or less, and which are neither held for nor restricted by donors for long-term purposes, to be cash 
and cash equivalents.

April 30, 2014 and 2013 
 
Accounts Receivable 
 
 
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. 
Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience 
and a review of subsequent collections. Balances that are outstanding after management has used 
reasonable collection efforts are written off At April 30, 2014 and 2013, management believes the amount 
of uncollectible balances to be insignificant and no allowance is reflected in the financial statements. 
Inventory 
 
reported at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or 
 
market value. 
Inventory consists of course material and is 
Investments 
 
 
Investment purchases are initially recorded at cost. Thereafter, investments are reported at their fair 
values in the statements of financial position. Net investment return is reported in the statements of 
 
activities and consists of interest and dividend income, and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses. 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment additions over $1,000 are recorded at cost, or if donated, at fair value on the date 
of donation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets ranging from 2 to 10 years. 
 
Capitalized leases, if any, are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments. 
Amortization relating to capitalized leases is calculated over the estimated useful life of the asset using the 
straight-line method and is included in depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. 
Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor replacements that do not improve or extend the useful 
lives of the respective assets are expensed currently. 
Grants Payable 
 
 
Grants payable, if any, are recorded as a liability and an expense in the year in which authorized by the 
 
COCPA’s Board of Directors 
Net Assets 
 
Net assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed 
restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified and reported as follows: 
 
Unrestricted Net Assets – Net assets available for use in general operations. 
 
Temporarily Restricted Net Assets – Net assets subject to donor restrictions that may or will be met by 
expenditures or actions of the COCPA and/or the passage of time.

Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2014 and 2013 
 
 
Permanently Restricted Net Assets – Net assets whose use is limited by donor-imposed restrictions that 
neither expire by the passage of time nor can be fulfilled or otherwise removed by action of the COCPA. 
 
 
The COCPA had only unrestricted net assets at April 30, 2014 and 2013. 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Revenue is recognized when earned. Membership dues are recognized ratably over the term of the 
membership period. Continuing professional education fees are recognized in the period in which the 
course is given. Peer review administrative fees are billed and recognized as revenue during the 
administrative year for which they apply. Other revenue is recognized when earned. As of April 30, 2014 
and 2013, the COCPA recorded deferred revenue, which represents the portion of revenue collected during 
the fiscal year that applies to the subsequent year’s activity. 
Contributed Services 
 
 
Contributed services are recorded if they create or enhance nonfinancial assets or require specialized skills 
that are provided by an individual possessing those skills and would typically need to be purchased if not 
provided by donation. A significant portion of the COCPA’s functions, which are conducted by unpaid 
volunteers, is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements because it does not meet the criteria 
 
for recognition by generally accepted accounting principles. 
Advertising Costs 
 
The COCPA uses advertising to promote its programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and 
totaled $137,592 and $118,391 for the years ended April 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for continuing 
professional education marketing. 
Functional Allocation of Expenses 
 
 
The costs of providing the various programs and activities have been summarized on a functional basis in 
the statements of activities. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs and 
 
supporting services benefitted. Note 7 presents total expenses by function. 
Income Taxes 
 
The COCPA is exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
However, income from activities not directly related to the COCPA’s tax-exempt purpose is subject to 
taxation as unrelated business income. The COCPA’s unrelated business income primarily represents 
advertising revenue associated with the COCPA’s NewsAccount publication and website. The COCPA did 
not incur any material income tax expense from these unrelated activities for the years ended April 30, 
2014 and 2013.

Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2014 and 2013 
 
 
Management performs an annual analysis of the COCPA’s various tax positions, assessing the likelihood of 
those positions being upheld upon examination by relevant tax authorities. Management believes the 
COCPA has conducted its operations in accordance with, and has properly maintained its tax-exempt status, 
and has taken no material uncertain tax positions that qualify for recognition or disclosure in the financial 
statements. The COCPA is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax 
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011. 
Estimates 
 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Financial Instruments and Credit Risk 
 
 
The COCPA manages deposit concentration risk by placing cash and money market accounts with financial 
institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. The COCPA monitors the accounts to ensure that 
amounts on deposit do not exceed insured limits. To date, the COCPA has not experienced losses in any of 
these accounts. Credit risk associated with accounts receivable is considered to be limited due to high 
historical collection rates and because substantial portions of the outstanding amounts are due from 
members. Investments are managed by diversified investment managers who are selected by the 
Investment Committee of the Board of Directors and whose performance is monitored by COCPA 
management and the Investment Committee. Although the fair values of investments are subject to 
 
fluctuation on a year-to-year basis, management and the Investment Committee believe that the 
investment policies and guidelines are prudent for the long-term welfare of the COCPA.
Subsequent Events 
 
 
The COCPA has evaluated subsequent events through July 16, 2014, the date which the financial statements 
 
were available to be issued. 
Note 3 -  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
 
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in the financial statements. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal, or most advantageous, market at the measurement date under current market conditions 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. 
 
Inputs used to determine fair value refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. 
Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the 
asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. 
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions 
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants 
Notes to Financial Statements 
April 30, 2014 and 2013 
 
 
A three-tier hierarchy categorizes the inputs as follows: 
 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the COCPA 
can access at the measurement date. 
 
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, 
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and market-corroborated 
inputs. 
 
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. In these situations, inputs are developed using 
the best information available in the circumstances. 
 
In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized 
within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized 
in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the 
entire measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input to entire measurement requires 
judgment, taking into account factors specific to the asset or liability. The categorization of an asset within 
the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the asset and does not necessarily correspond to 
the COCPA’s assessment of the quality, risk or liquidity profile of the asset or liability. 
 
All of the COCPA’s investment assets are classified within Level 1 because they are comprised of mutual 
funds with readily determinable fair values based on daily redemption values. 
 
 
The following table presents assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at April 30, 2014 and 2013: 
2014 2013

Note 8 -  Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and Trust 
 
Effective May 1, 1985, the COCPA established, as a separate accounting entity, the Colorado Society of CPAs 
Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and Trust for the benefit of eligible COCPA employees. No more than 25% of a 
participant’s compensation can be allocated to a participant’s account during any plan year. The COCPA is 
required to match participant contributions up to 5% of compensation. The residual up to the 25% 
limitation would result from a combination of participant contributions and annual discretionary 
contributions made by the COCPA of up to 5% of each participant’s compensation. In addition to the 
maximum deferred contribution of 25%, participants may also make after-tax contributions of up to 10% 
of compensation. The COCPA’s contributions for the years ended April 30, 2014 and 2013 were $62,961 
and $64,337, respectively. Neither the assets nor the liabilities of the profit sharing /401(k) plan and trust 
are reflected in these financial statements.

Note 10 - Related Party Transactions 
 
 
The COCPA is affiliated with The Educational Foundation of the Colorado Society of Certified Public 
Accountants (the “Foundation”), the primary purpose of which is to promote accounting education in 
Colorado and support individuals and institutions engaged in its study and teaching. The Foundation is a 
separately incorporated organization under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and is not controlled 
by the COCPA. The COCPA performs certain administrative, program support, and fundraising services for 
the benefit of the Foundation and also contributes certain amounts to the Foundation to cover additional 
expenses. The value of donated services and other contributions totaled $23,216 and $20,734, 
respectively, for the years ended April 30, 2014 and 2013. The COCPA remits to the Foundation 
contributions collected on its behalf. Amounts owed to the Foundation, which are included in accounts 
payable as of April 30, 2014 and 2013, were $3,056 and $3,875, respectively. 
 
Under the guidance of the Board of Directors, the COCPA also administers the Colorado Society of CPAs 
Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan and Trust, which was established for the benefit of the COCPA’s employees. 
 
Additionally, during the years ended April 30, 2014 and 2013, the COCPA paid $33,230 and $30,835, 
respectively, to Board members and Board members’ firms for services to the COCPA in the customary 
 
course of business.
